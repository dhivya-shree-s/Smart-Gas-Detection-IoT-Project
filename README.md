# Smart Gas Detection and Booking System (IoT)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project, selected for the **Naan Mudhalvan scheme**, is an **IoT-based solution** designed to enhance household safety by automating gas leakage detection and simplifying the LPG cylinder refill booking process.

The system provides **real-time alerts** for gas leaks, ensuring household safety, and includes a web-based feature for automated or manual gas booking based on cylinder weight/level.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Real-time Gas Leak Detection:** Uses a gas sensor (e.g., MQ-2) to continuously monitor the air for hazardous gas levels.
* **Automated Alert System:** Triggers immediate alerts (e.g., buzzer, LED, and mobile/web notification) upon detecting a leak.
* **IoT Integration:** Utilizes the **ESP8266** microcontroller for Wi-Fi connectivity.
* **Smart Gas Booking:** Integrates a load cell/weight sensor to determine gas level and automatically or manually initiate a refill request via a **Python backend**.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Microcontroller:** ESP8266
* **Backend/Logic:** Python
* **Data Storage:** SQL
* **Web Interface:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
